# Build your own testing libary

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to start testing in JavaScript.

## To get started

### Step 1

Pull down the repository. Make sure that you have Node installed locally and use `nvm use` to bring it inline with the project.
You can simply run the files directly using `node [filename]`


### Step 2
Open in your code editor, edit the file you want to run then in your terminal run it with node, for example:
```sh
 cd my-test-framework
 node 1-basic-unit-test.js
 ```

### Step 3
Follow in order of the numbers, there are two files for each, the one with "sol" in the name is the solution for reference.
